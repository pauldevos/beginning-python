### Setting Up Your Environment

### Installing Python
There's tons and tons and more tons of tutorials and blogs on installing Python on your machine (regardless of OS). I will likely paste a few popular ones here.
- Mac
    - brew install python3
    - download [Miniconda3](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh) and install it
        ```bash
        bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
        ```
- Windows
    - Official Python website
    - Anaconda3 Installer (Yes, the big ugly package)
    - Miniconda3
- Linux
    - Minconda3
    - sudo apt-get install python3 (altho, I think most distros today have it)
