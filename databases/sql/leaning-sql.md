### Learning SQL
Depending on the "flavor" or "dilect" you choose the SQL functions could be a little different. Some of the most popular SQL Databases are:
- SQL Server (Windows, Linux)
- Postgres (Linux, MacOS, Windows)
- SQLite3 (Linux, MacOS, Windows)
- MySQL (Linux, MacOS, Windows)

For the most part a large subset of all the SQL functions in each will be common to call. Most of those are likely to be a part of the "ANSI" SQL Standard.

Once you get some familiarity and confidence with any dialect of SQL you choose it would be good to start trying to test yourself. A few such places online to test your SQL chops include:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/database/)

Here's an overview of MySQL (not exhaustive) `SELECT` statement:
```sql

SELECT
    [ALL | DISTINCT | DISTINCTROW ]
    [HIGH_PRIORITY]
    [STRAIGHT_JOIN]
    [SQL_SMALL_RESULT] [SQL_BIG_RESULT] [SQL_BUFFER_RESULT]
    [SQL_NO_CACHE] [SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS]
    select_expr [, select_expr] ...
    [into_option]
    [FROM table_references
      [PARTITION partition_list]]
    [WHERE where_condition]
    [GROUP BY {col_name | expr | position}, ... [WITH ROLLUP]]
    [HAVING where_condition]
    [WINDOW window_name AS (window_spec)
        [, window_name AS (window_spec)] ...]
    [ORDER BY {col_name | expr | position}
      [ASC | DESC], ... [WITH ROLLUP]]
    [LIMIT {[offset,] row_count | row_count OFFSET offset}]
    [into_option]
    [FOR {UPDATE | SHARE}
        [OF tbl_name [, tbl_name] ...]
        [NOWAIT | SKIP LOCKED] 
      | LOCK IN SHARE MODE]
    [into_option]

into_option: {
    INTO OUTFILE 'file_name'
        [CHARACTER SET charset_name]
        export_options
  | INTO DUMPFILE 'file_name'
  | INTO var_name [, var_name] ...
}
```

Here's an overview of Postgres (not exhaustive) `SELECT` statement:

```sql

[ WITH [ RECURSIVE ] with_query [, ...] ]
SELECT [ ALL | DISTINCT [ ON ( expression [, ...] ) ] ]
    [ * | expression [ [ AS ] output_name ] [, ...] ]
    [ FROM from_item [, ...] ]
    [ WHERE condition ]
    [ GROUP BY grouping_element [, ...] ]
    [ HAVING condition [, ...] ]
    [ WINDOW window_name AS ( window_definition ) [, ...] ]
    [ { UNION | INTERSECT | EXCEPT } [ ALL | DISTINCT ] select ]
    [ ORDER BY expression [ ASC | DESC | USING operator ] [ NULLS { FIRST | LAST } ] [, ...] ]
    [ LIMIT { count | ALL } ]
    [ OFFSET start [ ROW | ROWS ] ]
    [ FETCH { FIRST | NEXT } [ count ] { ROW | ROWS } ONLY ]
    [ FOR { UPDATE | NO KEY UPDATE | SHARE | KEY SHARE } [ OF table_name [, ...] ] [ NOWAIT | SKIP LOCKED ] [...] ]

where from_item can be one of:

    [ ONLY ] table_name [ * ] [ [ AS ] alias [ ( column_alias [, ...] ) ] ]
                [ TABLESAMPLE sampling_method ( argument [, ...] ) [ REPEATABLE ( seed ) ] ]
    [ LATERAL ] ( select ) [ AS ] alias [ ( column_alias [, ...] ) ]
    with_query_name [ [ AS ] alias [ ( column_alias [, ...] ) ] ]
    [ LATERAL ] function_name ( [ argument [, ...] ] )
                [ WITH ORDINALITY ] [ [ AS ] alias [ ( column_alias [, ...] ) ] ]
    [ LATERAL ] function_name ( [ argument [, ...] ] ) [ AS ] alias ( column_definition [, ...] )
    [ LATERAL ] function_name ( [ argument [, ...] ] ) AS ( column_definition [, ...] )
    [ LATERAL ] ROWS FROM( function_name ( [ argument [, ...] ] ) [ AS ( column_definition [, ...] ) ] [, ...] )
                [ WITH ORDINALITY ] [ [ AS ] alias [ ( column_alias [, ...] ) ] ]
    from_item [ NATURAL ] join_type from_item [ ON join_condition | USING ( join_column [, ...] ) ]

and grouping_element can be one of:

    ( )
    expression
    ( expression [, ...] )
    ROLLUP ( { expression | ( expression [, ...] ) } [, ...] )
    CUBE ( { expression | ( expression [, ...] ) } [, ...] )
    GROUPING SETS ( grouping_element [, ...] )

and with_query is:

    with_query_name [ ( column_name [, ...] ) ] AS [ [ NOT ] MATERIALIZED ] ( select | values | insert | update | delete )

TABLE [ ONLY ] table_name [ * ]
```
