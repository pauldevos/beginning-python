### Learning SQL
Depending on the "flavor" or "dilect" you choose the SQL functions could be a little different. Some of the most popular SQL Databases are:
- SQL Server (Windows, Linux)
- Postgres (Linux, MacOS, Windows)
- SQLite3 (Linux, MacOS, Windows)
- MySQL (Linux, MacOS, Windows)

For the most part a large subset of all the SQL functions in each will be common to call. Most of those are likely to be a part of the "ANSI" SQL Standard.

Once you get some familiarity and confidence with any dialect of SQL you choose it would be good to start trying to test yourself. A few such places online to test your SQL chops include:
