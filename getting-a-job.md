### LinkedIn
Your linkedin profile should try to reflect your job worthiness. Depending on your experience level in a field , current financial situation, or other factors you can show more personality and more "picky" scenarios. However, if you are largely "mission" driven vs trying to break into a field you can also do some of that. But otherwise, I'd try to make it mostly just about your fit for the job vs beyond that. You can figure that out at the interview stages. But before that, you need to be found and if you're in tech LinkedIn is THE place to be found. 90% of job candidates are sourced on LinkedIn and 99% of the time recruiters check your LinkedIn _before_ contacting the candidate. So if your LinkedIn looks like a ghost town or is sloppy you are likely losing that battle unless you have a rockstar inside referral or some sort of public standing as a known expert. Well, this is geared towards beginners, so that is NOT you. YOU need a professionally complete LinkedIn profile.

### Familiarizing yourself with job target [tech] lingo
You should read through 20-30 jobs that sound good to you. You should copy and paste down the skills, the job duties, and anything else noteworthy about the jobs. Your goal is to learn how job orders are written and the terminology used. A lot of things can be said in many ways so saying it in the way that is used in the jobs you want is key.

Try to find the most common desired traits, skills, responsibilities, etc. You're going to want to express your past jobs in those ways, if at all possible.

Note: Possible project. Scrape jobs from Indeed, LinkedIn, JeffersonFrank, Dice, etc and parse out keywords found in articles to get an idea of popular tech skills.

### Traits Tech jobs value
So take your list from the above exercise. I want to add some as well, they may be redundant with what you've found. So just append whatever ones you didn't already have to your list.
- Show you are proactive with troubleshooting. You tinker with software. You download and install software, you get it working. You try new libraries (e.g. Python Flask or Sklearn) and try to build things. Employers want to know you can get "unstuck" and also bring new things to the company. IF you want to be remote, this is ESPECIALLY important. You won't have someone sitting next to you to troubleshoot what you're doing. You're going to have to solve a lot of your own "IT" problems.
- Show you're great at self managing your time and schedule. This is similar to troubleshooting, but this is not reactive. You see a product and you bring it to life. You see a process that needs to be put in place and you birth it. You massage it and make it a repeatable process.
- Tech tools, but not some laundry list of tools that have no grouping. You don't want to come across as a "tutorials king" who makes nothing valuable. You used Python to scrape data, you provisioned a database like SQLite or Postgres, and you wrote SQL to pull data from your database. If you list more than 2-3 languages you better have 20+ years experience programming. Otherwise, it jus shows you're good at nothing. Best case 2-3 languages and you talk about frameworks and problems with those 2-3 languages. 
- For example:
  - SQL and Databases. Database modeling, indexing, performance tuning. Normalization, 3NF, OLAP vs OLTP, Postgres, SQL Server, SQLite. You should be able to talk in depth about these things if it's a skill or language you wish to feature.
  - Python. Are you a web developer? Do you work with Flask or Django? Or how about asynchronous apps using Tornado, multithreaded, or Sockets? Or are you a Data Analyst/Scientist and use Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Plotly to draw insights from data. Or perhaps you do classical modeling (machine learning) using Sklearn and Statsmodels? Perhaps you're into Neural Networks doing object recognition of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Deep Learning frameworks like PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow.
  - Bottom line. If you start to list a language you better be able to convey how you're using that tool. After all, you're trying to get a job, not do another tutorial.
  - If you have tried a number of languages, you could say, familiar with a few of them and indicate some interest in learning them (if that's the case). But by and large, you don't want to convey someone who has no idea what they want AND no idea what to do with the tools. Laundry listing programming languages WILL TELL THAT STORY! "I don't know what I want and I don't know how these tools work together to build things." That's your story if you laundry list programming languages and tools. They should be grouped together in workflows.


### Express your past jobs in the language of the job(s) you want
If you pulled data from a database, if you interacted with any software, if you programmed anything... all of these things are potentially helpful for beginners who seemingly have very little "tech" experience to show. So going back through your jobs and figuring out ways you used technologies can help better show you are technically inclined. Now keep in mind, anything on your resume you SHOULD be able to speak to and be competent in. Anything on your resume is fair game for questions and skills testing. 

If you're at a job right now pay special attention to any technologies you use. Try to figure out ways to better extend them, perhaps you can figure out if there's a way to do programming with that tool. Maybe you might be able to interact with it in Python or SQL. Maybe you could use something your learn in Python or SQL and bring that to work at your current job. One thing I did at every job I did was bring in new tools and new solutions to problems. I automated processes. I created spreadsheets. I created Excel workbooks. I created Python scripts to automate SQL statement creation and execution. I build databases that other teammates could use and all of this was unprompted and not part of my job description. Every job could use technology. If you're hoping for a more technical job, a great way to get that next job is to show how you solve problems in your current job with technology. As you're trying to get a job in an industry where problem solving and learning are highly desired. Plain and simply, the more clearly you can convey this the quicker you'll get hired and the more you'll get paid.
