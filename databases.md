### Working with Databases

There's a ton of databases out there from relational databases to other "NoSQL" databases. For the scope of this course we'll likely only cover a few of them. Most likely two Relational Databases (RDBMS) and probably one NoSQL DB.


### Relational Databases
- SQLite
- Postgres (or PostgreSQL)


### Non-Relational Databases
- ElasticSearch
- MongoDB


### SQLite
- [Dot Commands](https://sqlite.org/cli.html#special_commands_to_sqlite3_dot_commands_)
- [Import CSV Data as a Table](https://sqlite.org/cli.html#csv_import)
